# Floating Point Adder in C/C++

This project performs Single-Precision Floating-Point addition for 2 sets of 8-input signed decimals.

Unpipelined and pipelined logic are implemented. Results dispalyed and are cross compared in console. 

Run EE271_MiniProject1.sln for adder. EE275FP.sln is needed to convert decimal inputs to Floating Point values in binary form.
